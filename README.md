Overview
This Tableau dashboard provides a detailed and interactive analysis of key business metrics, enabling users to explore sales performance, profitability, and return rates. With dynamic visualizations and filters, the dashboard offers an easy-to-use interface for examining and interpreting data in real-time.


1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
   
Profit Margin: Displays the ratio of total profit to total sales, giving insights into overall profitability.

Return Rate: Measures the ratio of quantity returned to quantity ordered, helping track product returns and customer satisfaction.

Sales: Provides a clear view of total sales, allowing for performance tracking and comparison.

2. Metric Parameter for Dynamic Visualizations
   
A Metric Parameter allows users to toggle between three key metrics: Sales, Profit, and Number of Orders . The visualizations and KPIs dynamically update to reflect the selected metric. For example, selecting "Sales" will update the charts to focus on sales-related insights, such as "Sales by Category."

3. Interactive Filters
The dashboard includes filters for Year and Region, which allow users to refine their analysis based on time periods or specific geographic areas. A button is provided to show or hide these filters as needed.

4. Top 5 Products
   
Regardless of the selected metric or filters, the dashboard consistently highlights the Top 5 Products based on the chosen metric. This ensures that users always have a quick view of the best-performing products.

5. Dynamic Filtering with Category Chart
    
An interactive Category Chart allows users to select a product category, filtering the data across all visualizations and KPIs to focus on the chosen category. This interactivity enhances the exploration of specific categories and products.

6. Trend and Average Lines
    
Where applicable, Average and Trend Lines are included in the visualizations to help identify key patterns or trends over time.

7. Company Logo Interaction
    
Clicking on the company logo in the dashboard will redirect users to the publicly available version on Tableau Public, making the dashboard accessible for sharing or public viewing.


This Tableau dashboard offers a dynamic, interactive platform for analyzing key business metrics, including profit margin, return rate, and sales. Its flexible design, combined with customizable metrics and filtering options, makes it a powerful tool for driving data-driven business decisions.
